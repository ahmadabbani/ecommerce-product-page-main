# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page solution

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
Note: I have added some animations and also made additions to the cart, such as subtotal calculations that increases and decreases every time you add or remove an item from the cart. I also use the Bootstrap carousel for the slides and place the carousel inside a Bootstrap modal as a lightbox. I'm not sure if it's the perfect way, but it works.. If anyone has a little bit of time to read my code and provide feedback, it will be appreciated.
